pibus 1.0

This is a very simple project to fetch information about my local bus stop in
London and display the number of minutes until the next bus on an e-Ink
display attached to a Raspberry Pi.

You need to put a font in this directory called font.ttf and unless it's the
same version of Courier that I used, you'll need to adjust the co-ordinates
the various bits of text are rendered at.

You also need to figure out the ID of your bus stop. You can get a list of them
from http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/tfl-bus-stop-locations-and-routes

Then run bus.sh -b BUSSTOPID -l BUSROUTENAME
